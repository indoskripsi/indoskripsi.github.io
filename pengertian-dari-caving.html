Last year a hurricane was experienced by my family and me for the first time. It was hurricane Ellen, and much damage to our property and neighbourhood was caused by its fierce winds of 200 miles per hour and its heavy rains. The old oak tree im our back yard was uprooted and hurled across the roof of our house, creating a large hole through which the rain poured in. Our living room was flooded by the water which rose to a height of three feet. When we began to think that the worst of the storm was over, we heard a loud crash and looked out the window to see that our car had been hit by our neighbour fallen tree, caving m the roof and breaking all the windows.</a>

                                            Penelusuran Gua (Caving)
	Penelusuran gua merupakan salah satu kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang sangat menarik. Sebagi kegiatan olahraga, kegiatan ini memiliki tantangan khusus yang tidak bisa ditemui pada kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang lain. Daya tarik lain dari kegiatan ini adalah medannya sering terdapat keunikan dan kecantikan yang tidak ada di dunia luar. Di dalam gua sering terdapat ornamen batuan cantik hasil dari bentukan alam. Ornamen-ornamen tersebut terbentuk oleh tetesan air yang berlangsung selama ratusan bahkan ribuan tahun. Kadang-kadang gua juga menyimpan misteri kehidupan masa lalu. Saat ini banyak orang yang tergila-gila dengan kegiatan ini.
	Kegiatan penelusuran gua memang sedikit berbeda dibanding kegiatan penjelajahan yang lain. Untuk melakukan kegiatan ini penelusur harus membekali diri dengan berbagai kemampuan. Mengingat medannya benar-benar berbeda karena berupa bentukan alam yang berada di bawah permukaan bumi. Penelusuran gua tidak hanya membutuhkan kemampuan fisik, tetapi juga pengetahuan tentang habitat hidup dalam gua, struktur tanah dan batuan, dan Speleologi (pengetahuan tentang gua).
	Kegiatan penelusuran gua harus dilakukan secara berkelompok. Tidak dibenarkan melakukan penelusuran seorang diri. Untuk menelusuri gua, sebuah tim paling tidak terdiri atas empat orang. Keputusan ini berdasarkan atas pertimbangan bahwa jika terjadi kecelakaan pada salah satu anggota kelompok, satu orang dibutuhkan untuk menjaga sedangkan dua orang lainnya bertugas untuk melakukan pertolongan.
	Untuk menjaga keamanan selama penelusuran, maka penelusur gua harus menyiapkan berbagai perlengkapan dasar, memiliki pengetahuan dan keterampilan (tentang gua, alat, dan penggunaannya), serta teknik penelusuran. Kemampuan dan teknik tersebut harus senantiasa dilatih agar lebih terasah. Berbagai persiapan yang dilakukan tersebut bertujuan untuk menghindari sesuatu yang tidak diinginkan yang mungkin terjadi di dalam gua. Ketika terjadi musibah, setiap penelusur harus tetap bertindak dengan tenang, tidak panik, dan wajib patuh pada instruksi pemimpin penelusuran.

                                            Find passive sentences on the paragraph below. Then change them into active sentences. Last year a hurricane was experienced by my family and me for the first time. It was Hurricane Ellen, and much damage to our property and neighborhood was caused by its fierce winds of 200 miles per hour and its heavy rains. The old oak tree in our backyard was uprooted and hurled across the roof of our house, creating a large hole through which the rain poured in. Our living room was flooded by the water, which rose to a height of three feet. When we began to think the worst of the storm was over, we heard a loud crash and looked out the window to see that our car had been hit by our neighbor’s fallen tree, caving in the roof and breaking all the windows.Having recently moved to the East Coast from North Dakota, we thought that hurricane was little more than a thunderstorm. Next time, when people in our area are advised to evacuate before a hurricane comes, I’m sure our family will be the first to leave.  Example:Passive: A hurricane was experienced by my family and me for the first time.Active : My family and I experienced a hurricane for the first time. ​</a>

                                            Last year a hurricane was experienced by my family and me for the first time. It
was Hurricane Ellen, and much damage to our property and neighborhood was caused
by its fierce winds of 200 miles per hour and its heavy rains. The old oak tree in our
backyard was uprooted and hurled across the roof of our house, creating a large hole
through which the rain poured in. Our living room was flooded by the water, which
rose to a height of three feet. When we began to think that the worst of the storm was
over, we heard a loud crash and looked out the window to see that our car had been
hit by our neighbor’s fallen tree, caving in the roof and breaking all the windows.
Having recently moved to the East Coast from North Dakota, we thought that a
hurricane was little more than a thunderstorm. Next time, when people in our area are
advised to evacuate before a hurricane comes, I’m sure our family will be the first to
leave.</a>

                                            16. A month ago, I had no idea that on Saturday afternoon in November I’d be hanging 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me, and realized why people love rock-climbing.My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Center on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn’t wonderful, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were pleases to be out of the city and in the fresh air.On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while Sister Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area.We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spend the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last – covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we’ve done.What is the writer trying to do in the text?A.

                                            Penelusuran Gua (Caving) 	Penelusuran gua merupakan salah satu kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang sangat menarik. Sebagi kegiatan olahraga, kegiatan ini memiliki tantangan khusus yang tidak bisa ditemui pada kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang lain. Daya tarik lain dari kegiatan ini adalah medannya sering terdapat keunikan dan kecantikan yang tidak ada di dunia luar. Di dalam gua sering terdapat ornamen batuan cantik hasil dari bentukan alam. Ornamen-ornamen tersebut terbentuk oleh tetesan air yang berlangsung selama ratusan bahkan ribuan tahun. Kadang-kadang gua juga menyimpan misteri kehidupan masa lalu. Saat ini banyak orang yang tergila-gila dengan kegiatan ini. 	Kegiatan penelusuran gua memang sedikit berbeda dibanding kegiatan penjelajahan yang lain. Untuk melakukan kegiatan ini penelusur harus membekali diri dengan berbagai kemampuan. Mengingat medannya benar-benar berbeda karena berupa bentukan alam yang berada di bawah permukaan bumi. Penelusuran gua tidak hanya membutuhkan kemampuan fisik, tetapi juga pengetahuan tentang habitat hidup dalam gua, struktur tanah dan batuan, dan Speleologi (pengetahuan tentang gua). 	Kegiatan penelusuran gua harus dilakukan secara berkelompok. Tidak dibenarkan melakukan penelusuran seorang diri. Untuk menelusuri gua, sebuah tim paling tidak terdiri atas empat orang. Keputusan ini berdasarkan atas pertimbangan bahwa jika terjadi kecelakaan pada salah satu anggota kelompok, satu orang dibutuhkan untuk menjaga sedangkan dua orang lainnya bertugas untuk melakukan pertolongan. 	Untuk menjaga keamanan selama penelusuran, maka penelusur gua harus menyiapkan berbagai perlengkapan dasar, memiliki pengetahuan dan keterampilan (tentang gua, alat, dan penggunaannya), serta teknik penelusuran. Kemampuan dan teknik tersebut harus senantiasa dilatih agar lebih terasah. Berbagai persiapan yang dilakukan tersebut bertujuan untuk menghindari sesuatu yang tidak diinginkan yang mungkin terjadi di dalam gua. Ketika terjadi musibah, setiap penelusur harus tetap bertindak dengan tenang, tidak panik, dan wajib patuh pada instruksi pemimpin penelusuran.

                                             My friend Bono and I had arrived at the Activity Center on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were pleases to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while Sister Retno and Tiwuk had come with Amanda. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the  weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spend the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Bono and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we've done.What is the writer trying to do in the text?​</a>

                        Kita dapat terinfeksi cacing perut mulai dari berpindahnya telur cacing melalui tangan, karena itu tangan kita harus dicuci sebelum makan agar tidak terkena cacing. bila sudah terlanjur terkena cacing, cacing akan tumbuh dan berkembang biak dengan menyerap nutrisi makanan kita di dalam usus kita. bila dibiarkan, cacing akan menggumpal dan merusak organ pencernaan hingga membuat cacing menguasai tubuh. pencegahanya yaitu rajin meminum obat cacing 6 bulan sekali agar mencegah timbulnya cacing di perut kita.<br /><br /><br />Semoga Bermanfaat!<br />

                            7. Penelusuran Gua (Caving)
	Penelusuran gua merupakan salah satu kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang sangat menarik. Sebagi kegiatan olahraga, kegiatan ini memiliki tantangan khusus yang tidak bisa ditemui pada kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang lain. Daya tarik lain dari kegiatan ini adalah medannya sering terdapat keunikan dan kecantikan yang tidak ada di dunia luar. Di dalam gua sering terdapat ornamen batuan cantik hasil dari bentukan alam. Ornamen-ornamen tersebut terbentuk oleh tetesan air yang berlangsung selama ratusan bahkan ribuan tahun. Kadang-kadang gua juga menyimpan misteri kehidupan masa lalu. Saat ini banyak orang yang tergila-gila dengan kegiatan ini.
	Kegiatan penelusuran gua memang sedikit berbeda dibanding kegiatan penjelajahan yang lain. Untuk melakukan kegiatan ini penelusur harus membekali diri dengan berbagai kemampuan. Mengingat medannya benar-benar berbeda karena berupa bentukan alam yang berada di bawah permukaan bumi. Penelusuran gua tidak hanya membutuhkan kemampuan fisik, tetapi juga pengetahuan tentang habitat hidup dalam gua, struktur tanah dan batuan, dan Speleologi (pengetahuan tentang gua).
	Kegiatan penelusuran gua harus dilakukan secara berkelompok. Tidak dibenarkan melakukan penelusuran seorang diri. Untuk menelusuri gua, sebuah tim paling tidak terdiri atas empat orang. Keputusan ini berdasarkan atas pertimbangan bahwa jika terjadi kecelakaan pada salah satu anggota kelompok, satu orang dibutuhkan untuk menjaga sedangkan dua orang lainnya bertugas untuk melakukan pertolongan.
	Untuk menjaga keamanan selama penelusuran, maka penelusur gua harus menyiapkan berbagai perlengkapan dasar, memiliki pengetahuan dan keterampilan (tentang gua, alat, dan penggunaannya), serta teknik penelusuran. Kemampuan dan teknik tersebut harus senantiasa dilatih agar lebih terasah. Berbagai persiapan yang dilakukan tersebut bertujuan untuk menghindari sesuatu yang tidak diinginkan yang mungkin terjadi di dalam gua. Ketika terjadi musibah, setiap penelusur harus tetap bertindak dengan tenang, tidak panik, dan wajib patuh pada instruksi pemimpin penelusuran.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE
</p><p>What is the difference between active and passive voice?
</p><p>In active voice, the subject does the acting: 
</p><p> The committee made the decision.
</p><p>In passive voice, the subject is acted upon:
</p><p>The decision was made (by the committee).
</p><p>The subject decision in the second sentence does nothing. In other words, the subject 
</p><p>is passive. It did no acting; it was acted upon. Writers may use the passive voice to 
</p><p>avoid naming the actor. In fact, the actor may be unknown. Consider this sentence:
</p><p>Somebody shot John F. Kennedy in 1963.
</p><p>This sentence is in the active voice. Such a sentence emphasizes the subject 
</p><p>somebody. The writer may not want to emphasize the actor in this case.
</p><p>The passive voice, on the other hand, would allow a writer to emphasize the 
</p><p>importance of the person or thing acted upon. Consider the following sentence:
</p><p>John F. Kennedy was shot in 1963.
</p><p>Such a sentence in the passive voice allows a writer to stress the importance of the 
</p><p>person or event acted upon—in this case, John F. Kennedy.
</p><p>In most writing situations, you should use the active rather than the 
</p><p>passive voice because the active voice is more forceful and precise. Generally, 
</p><p>use the passive voice only when it’s not important for the reader to know who or 
</p><p>what is doing the acting.

                            12. Find passive sentences on the paragraph below. Then change them into active sentences. Last year a hurricane was experienced by my family and me for the first time. It was Hurricane Ellen, and much damage to our property and neighborhood was caused by its fierce winds of 200 miles per hour and its heavy rains. The old oak tree in our backyard was uprooted and hurled across the roof of our house, creating a large hole through which the rain poured in. Our living room was flooded by the water, which rose to a height of three feet. When we began to think the worst of the storm was over, we heard a loud crash and looked out the window to see that our car had been hit by our neighbor’s fallen tree, caving in the roof and breaking all the windows.Having recently moved to the East Coast from North Dakota, we thought that hurricane was little more than a thunderstorm. Next time, when people in our area are advised to evacuate before a hurricane comes, I’m sure our family will be the first to leave.  Example:Passive: A hurricane was experienced by my family and me for the first time.Active : My family and I experienced a hurricane for the first time. ​</h2><br />

The subject is the ones in bold.</p><strong>Its fierce winds </strong>caused the damage on the property and neigbourhood.(however, it is better to use 'led to' (past participle of lead) in English context for such sentence. So it becomes like this "Its fierce winds led to the damage on...")<strong>It</strong> uprooted and hurled the oak tree in our backyard across the roof of the house<strong>.

The yawning caverns here are truly spectacular. Tu Lan Cave is a “wet cave”, and a visit here includes swimming through the cave-systems river. The other most popular excursion is to the Phong Nha Caves, when the interior is accessed by boat. You can access Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park from Son Trach. *

                            26. Last year a hurricane was experienced by my family and me for the first time. It
was Hurricane Ellen, and much damage to our property and neighborhood was caused
by its fierce winds of 200 miles per hour and its heavy rains. The old oak tree in our
backyard was uprooted and hurled across the roof of our house, creating a large hole
through which the rain poured in. Our living room was flooded by the water, which
rose to a height of three feet. When we began to think that the worst of the storm was
over, we heard a loud crash and looked out the window to see that our car had been
hit by our neighbor’s fallen tree, caving in the roof and breaking all the windows.
Having recently moved to the East Coast from North Dakota, we thought that a
hurricane was little more than a thunderstorm. Next time, when people in our area are
advised to evacuate before a hurricane comes, I’m sure our family will be the first to
leave.</h2><br />

                            27. 16. A month ago, I had no idea that on Saturday afternoon in November I’d be hanging 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now I looked down at the river far below me, and realized why people love rock-climbing.My friend Matt and I had arrived at the Activity Center on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn’t wonderful, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were pleases to be out of the city and in the fresh air.On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while Sister Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area.We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spend the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last – covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we’ve done.What is the writer trying to do in the text?A.

                            35. Penelusuran Gua (Caving) 	Penelusuran gua merupakan salah satu kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang sangat menarik. Sebagi kegiatan olahraga, kegiatan ini memiliki tantangan khusus yang tidak bisa ditemui pada kegiatan penjelajahan alam yang lain. Daya tarik lain dari kegiatan ini adalah medannya sering terdapat keunikan dan kecantikan yang tidak ada di dunia luar. Di dalam gua sering terdapat ornamen batuan cantik hasil dari bentukan alam. Ornamen-ornamen tersebut terbentuk oleh tetesan air yang berlangsung selama ratusan bahkan ribuan tahun. Kadang-kadang gua juga menyimpan misteri kehidupan masa lalu. Saat ini banyak orang yang tergila-gila dengan kegiatan ini. 	Kegiatan penelusuran gua memang sedikit berbeda dibanding kegiatan penjelajahan yang lain. Untuk melakukan kegiatan ini penelusur harus membekali diri dengan berbagai kemampuan. Mengingat medannya benar-benar berbeda karena berupa bentukan alam yang berada di bawah permukaan bumi. Penelusuran gua tidak hanya membutuhkan kemampuan fisik, tetapi juga pengetahuan tentang habitat hidup dalam gua, struktur tanah dan batuan, dan Speleologi (pengetahuan tentang gua). 	Kegiatan penelusuran gua harus dilakukan secara berkelompok. Tidak dibenarkan melakukan penelusuran seorang diri. Untuk menelusuri gua, sebuah tim paling tidak terdiri atas empat orang. Keputusan ini berdasarkan atas pertimbangan bahwa jika terjadi kecelakaan pada salah satu anggota kelompok, satu orang dibutuhkan untuk menjaga sedangkan dua orang lainnya bertugas untuk melakukan pertolongan. 	Untuk menjaga keamanan selama penelusuran, maka penelusur gua harus menyiapkan berbagai perlengkapan dasar, memiliki pengetahuan dan keterampilan (tentang gua, alat, dan penggunaannya), serta teknik penelusuran. Kemampuan dan teknik tersebut harus senantiasa dilatih agar lebih terasah. Berbagai persiapan yang dilakukan tersebut bertujuan untuk menghindari sesuatu yang tidak diinginkan yang mungkin terjadi di dalam gua. Ketika terjadi musibah, setiap penelusur harus tetap bertindak dengan tenang, tidak panik, dan wajib patuh pada instruksi pemimpin penelusuran.

                            39.  My friend Bono and I had arrived at the Activity Center on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were pleases to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while Sister Retno and Tiwuk had come with Amanda. We had come from various places and none of us knew the area. We knew we were going to spend the  weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spend the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Bono and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last - covered in mud but pleased and excited by what we've done.What is the writer trying to do in the text?​</h2><br />
