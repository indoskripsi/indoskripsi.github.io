                                            Here is my unforgettable experience. One day I joined a story telling contest. Two of my friends and I had been chosen to take a part in the final round at the district level. I was very happy and eager to win the competition.For preparation, I had to memorize and understand the story well.My teacher guided and taught me pronunciation, facial expression and gestures. One day, before performing, my friends and I were busy to prepare the props and costumes for the competition. Thing that make me sad was my teacher rented the props and costumes for my friends but not for me. My two friends had beautiful costumes and luxurious props. Although I just wore the simple ones, I performed my best to win the competition.The competition started. I got number 29 and my friends got number 5 and 10. I was nervous but I showed my best performance on stage. Lots of people took photos and videos of me. Finally, anxiety was gone after I had finished performing. And then, the announcement came which made three of us very uneasy. Luckily I was chosen as the first winner. I went to the stage and all the judges congratulated me and gave a plague, trophy, and money. I was very happy

me pronunciation, facial expression and gestures. One day, before performing, my friends and I were

was gone after I had finished performing. And then, the announcement came which made three of us very

Two of my friends and I had been chosen to take a part in the final round at the district level. I was very happy and eager to win the competition. For preparation, I had to memorize and understand the story well. My teacher guided and taught me pronunciation, facial expression and gestures. One day, before performing, my friends and I were busy to prepare the props and costumes for the competition. Thing that makes me sad was my teacher rented the props and costumes for my friends but not for me. My two friends had beautiful costumes and luxurious props. Although I just wore the simple ones, I performed my best to win the competition. The competition started. I got number 29 and my friends got number 5 and 10. I was nervous but I showed my best performance on stage. Lots of people took photos and videos of me. Finally, anxiety was gone after I had finished performing. And then, the announcement came which made three of us very uneasy. Luckily I was chosen as the first winner. I went to the stage and all the judges congratulated me and gave a plague, trophy, and money. I was very happy. Question: Why did the writer feel sad before the competition? ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Inilah pengalaman saya yang tak terlupakan. Suatu hari saya mengikuti kontes bercerita. Saya dan dua teman saya terpilih untuk mengikuti babak final di tingkat kabupaten. Saya sangat senang dan bersemangat untuk memenangkan kompetisi. Untuk persiapan, saya harus menghafal dan memahami cerita dengan baik. Guru saya membimbing dan mengajari saya pengucapan, ekspresi wajah dan gerak tubuh. Suatu hari, sebelum tampil, saya dan teman-teman sibuk mempersiapkan alat peraga dan kostum untuk kompetisi. Hal yang membuat saya sedih adalah guru saya menyewakan alat peraga dan kostum untuk teman-teman saya tetapi tidak untuk saya. Kedua teman saya memiliki kostum yang indah dan alat peraga yang mewah. Meskipun saya hanya mengenakan yang sederhana, saya melakukan yang terbaik untuk memenangkan kompetisi. Kompetisi dimulai. Saya mendapat nomor 29 dan teman saya mendapat nomor 5 dan 10. Saya gugup tapi saya menunjukkan penampilan terbaik saya di atas panggung. Banyak orang yang mengambil foto dan video saya. Akhirnya, kecemasan itu hilang setelah saya selesai tampil. Dan kemudian, pengumuman datang yang membuat kami bertiga sangat gelisah. Beruntung saya terpilih sebagai pemenang pertama. Saya naik ke panggung dan semua juri memberi selamat kepada saya dan memberikan wabah, piala, dan uang. saya sangat senang</p><br />

                            22. Here is my unforgettable experience. One day I joined a story telling contest. Two of my friends 
and I had been chosen to take a part in the final round at the district level. I was very happy and eager to 
win the competition.
For preparation, I had to memorize and understand the story well. My teacher guided and taught 
me pronunciation, facial expression and gestures. One day, before performing, my friends and I were 
busy to prepare the props and costumes for the competition. Thing that me sad was my teacher rented the 
props and costumes for my friends but not for me. My two friends had beautiful costumes and luxurious 
props. Although I just wore the simple ones, I performed my best to win the competition.
The competition started. I got number 29 and my friends got number 5 and 10. I was nervous but 
I showed my best performance on stage. Lots of people took photos and videos of me. Finally, anxiety 
was gone after I had finished performing. And then, the announcement came which made three of us very 
uneasy. Luckily I was chosen as the first winner. I went to the stage and all the judges congratulated me 
and gave a plague, trophy, and money. I was very happy.

Two of my friends and I had been chosen to take a part in the final round at the district level. I was very happy and eager to win the competition. For preparation, I had to memorize and understand the story well.My teacher guided and taught me pronunciation, facial expression and gestures. One day, before performing, my friends and I were busy to prepare the props and costumes for the competition. Thing that me sad was my teacher rented the props and costumes for my friends but not for me. My two friends had beautiful costumes and luxurious props. Although I just wore the simple ones, I performed my best to win the competition. The competition started. I got number 29 and my friends got number 5 and 10. I was nervous but I showed my best performance on stage. Lots of people took photos and videos of me. Finally, anxiety was gone after I had finished performing. And then, the announcement came which made three of us very uneasy. Luckily I was chosen as the first winner. I went to the stage and all the judges congratulated me and gave a plague, trophy, and money. I was very happy.  Why did the writer feel sad before the competition ?</h2><br />
